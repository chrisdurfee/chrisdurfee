# Hi there, I‚Äôm Chris!

I‚Äôm a software engineer with **20+ years of experience**, and I‚Äôve had the opportunity to take on a wide range of roles‚Äîmost recently serving as the CTO of a tech company. My career spans everything from developing secure video streaming platforms, social media integrations, billing platforms, payment processors, CRMs, automated communication systems, to building mobile, web, server-side, and installable desktop applications.

I‚Äôm passionate about **open source** and love sharing tools and frameworks that help other developers jumpstart their projects. Here on my profile, you‚Äôll find some of my open source work, including the **Base Framework** and various example apps built on top of it.

## üå± Open Source Projects

### Base Framework
A modular framework designed to simplify client-side and server-side rendering. **Base** focuses on reusability, scalability, and performance. It provides a modern approach to data binding, layouts, event handling, and more, without the need for heavy build processes.

- **Core Features**:  
  - Modular structure with easy-to-extend modules (ajax, data, routing, etc.)  
  - Native JavaScript for layouts and components (no compile step)  
  - Powerful data-binding (supports deep nested data)  
  - Lifecycle methods for components  
  - Support for both server-side and client-side rendering  

- **Learn More**:  
  - [Base Wiki](https://github.com/chrisdurfee/base/wiki)  
  - [Base Converter (ChatGPT powered)](https://github.com/chrisdurfee/base-converter)  
  - [Base Atoms Package](https://github.com/chrisdurfee/base-atoms)  
  - [Base Organisms Package](https://github.com/chrisdurfee/base-organisms)  

### Base Example App Shell
A simple single-page application demonstrating the capabilities of the **Base Framework**. It‚Äôs a great starting point if you want to see how Base works in a real app context.
